VERSION NUMBER  CAT  Description

r1455   000002  MEM  vm_object reference counts are too conservative.

r1455   000005  FUN  Scopes with more than 126(?) SIDs not supported.

r1584   000006  FUN  Unable to publish when data=0 and dlen=0.  Should 
                     create only meta.
                TEST check_publish.sh:  $PUBLISH (no arguments)

r1617   000009  FUN  EV_ONESHOT event flag does not work. 
                TEST check_bug_000009.sh

r1630   000012  FUN  Reading page publications through the file system
                     gives the whole publication, not just the one page.

r1721   000015  CRI  inode numbers are a hack.  The file system interface
                     will cause crashes or behave erratically soon after 
                     there are too many publications so that inode numbers 
                     are rolled over.


Unreproducible/Old bugs (please test)

 LAST
 SEEN   NUMBER  CAT  Description

r1455   000001  MEM  Writes to a memory object after publication 
                     are visible to subscribers.

r1455   000003  FUN  Subscribe-in-other-scope not supported.
                TST  r1775: subscribing in any scope works.

r1455   000004  CRI  Crashes on unmount of vnodes still in use.
                     [Probably fixed but test cases missing.]
                TST  r1775: does not crash.

r1630   000013  FUN  There is something fishy with page RIDs.  They
                     seem to differ from run to run.  Should depend
                     only on content.
                TST  r1775: page RIDs equal across runs.
